    </div>
    <p class="skills-text">
      I am an aspiring web developer specializing in full stack JavaScript. Although I have experience with various front end libraries and frameworks, including JQuery, Vue and React, for the last year I have been focusing mostly on the MEAN stack - Angular or AngularJS, Node, Express and MongoDB. I enjoy working in Angular because of the clean architecture, the clarity of its template syntax, and the secure development experience provided by Typescript.
    </p>
    <p class="skills-text">
      For styling, I have used CSS frameworks such as Bootstrap and Materialize, but overall prefer working in native CSS or Sass. I’m also familiar with various tools used in modern development, such as Webpack for module bundling, NPM for package management and build scripts and Git / GitHub for version control.
    </p>
    <p class="skills-text">
      Front end development makes up about two third of my experience, but I’ve also done a fair amount of work in Node, especially using the Express framework and MongoDB. I’ve built RESTful APIs to support CRUD applications, and I’ve also implemented authentication modules both locally and using OAuth. I have some experience creating databases with MySQL and writing SQL queries.
    </p>
    <p class="skills-text">
      As a developer, I like to write code which is clean and concise yet readable, explicit and easy to maintain, making use of any language features that improve code clarity. I particularly value the new features of ES6, the type-checking capability of TypeScript and improved code structure made possible by using Sass.
